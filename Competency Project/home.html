        <p>
          Hello Readers! My name is Yadan Liu, but here in the U.S.I go by
          Dannie. Originally from China, I moved to Omaha, Nebraska to earn my
          Master's Degree in Rehabilitation Sciences. After earning the degree,
          I decided to move to Houston, Texas for better access to jobs. Within
          a week, I was fully packed and on a southbound flight. Two days later,
          I had a job working in an Occupational Therapy clinic.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't plan on staying too long. I figured that after a couple
          years, my adventure would come to an end, and I would move back to
          China better prepared for my career. But fate had other plans because
          after only two months in Houston, I met the man who is now my husband.
          5 years later, we're still here and building our life together. But
          I'm getting ahead of myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          While working at the Occupational Therapy clinic, I was inspired to
          pursue an Associate's Degree in an Occupational Therapy Assistant
          program in Houston. While studying there, I participated in a seminar
          about Assistive Technology, and I decided would use the new degree and
          previous healthcare experience to test into the field. I passed my
          exams and got certified as both an Occupational Therapy Assistant and
          an Assistive Technology Professional shortly after my wedding was held
          in the final days before Covid lockdowns began.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking for a new adventure with my husband, we decided to start
          looking for jobs in the Seattle area. We've been in Washington now for
          almost two years, and it's definitely had its ups and downs. My
          husband landed a great tech job, we bought a townhome together, and
          just a month ago, I gave birth to our first child. On the other hand,
          I was laid off in February, a week before I found out I was pregnant.
          But after talking it out with my husband and seeing the success his
          career has brought him and after I took a few programming courses on
          Udemy, I decided I would use my newfound freedom to study web
          development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy hiking in Washington State and traveling with my family as
          much as I can. while traveling, I also like to take some beautiful
          pictures.
        </p>
        <p>
          And here, dear readers, do you find me now. I am passionately studying
          away for what may well become my greatest adventure yet (okay, maybe
          second to motherhood). I'm excited to have you along as part of my
          journey!
