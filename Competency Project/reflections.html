      I am an occupational therapy practitioner and a wheelchair specialist, but
      I got laid off in February this year. I have my masterâ€™s degree in the
      medical field of rehabilitation sciences. A week after getting laid off, I
      found out that I am about to be a mom. I wanted to learn something new
      that could make me feel more passionate. I have always been interested in
      web design. I designed websites, business cards, and posters with other
      coworkers during my medical career. Being able to create something new has
      always been my passion. My husband is a software engineer; he has
      motivated me to be a web developer. The experience of being laid off has
      taught me a lot about careers and life.

      I have learned a lot about CSS and HTML by doing this competence project.
      Some of the concepts I definitely need more practice such as CSS flex box
      or CSS grid. Also Learning how to manage files while creating HTML files
      and CSS files is also essential skills.

      It has been a journey for me this semester. Most importantly, I had a new
      born baby. It was not easy to manage life and study at same time. Even
      right now I am typing thes words, I need to constantly check on my son. It
      is hard but I keep telling myself that I can do it and here I am.( I am
      almost done with this semester.)
